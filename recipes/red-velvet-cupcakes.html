                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                        Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners. </li>
                    <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, 
                        baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. </li>
                    <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric 
                        mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 
                        minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in sour cream, 
                        milk, food color, and vanilla. Gradually beat in flour 
                        mixture on low speed until just blended; do not overbeat. 
                        Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 
                        2/3 full. </li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into 
                        a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the 
                        pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from 
                        the pans; cool completely. </li>
                    <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, 
                        butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until 
                        light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until 
                        smooth. </li>
                    <li> Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
